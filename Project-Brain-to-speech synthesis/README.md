# Brain-to-speech synthesis

This project aims to create a system that can translate neural signals into comprehensible speechï¼ŒBrainwave data can be converted into verbal descriptions

## Team information

Team name: ML
Team`s member and Neptun Codes : Ma Zihan (FA8Y9M),Liu Hao (YRZNEP)

## Dependencies
The scripts require Python >= 3.8 and the following packages
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib]( https://matplotlib.org/)

## Dataset
*  [Dataset]([https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://osf.io/nrgx6/))

## What we need to do
First, we need to perform data preprocessing to address noise and erroneous values. Subsequently, an appropriate model is selected, followed by model training. Through the use of visualizations, suitable parameters are tuned to effectively enhance the accuracy of the results.

## Current progress description
Dear professor, because we enrolled late, we have many courses behind us, and we are currently undergoing midterm exams. We have not completed the data preprocessing. We will catch up as soon as possible to ensure that we can complete this experiment efficiently within the specified time.
